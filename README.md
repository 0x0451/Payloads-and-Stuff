# Payloads-and-Stuff


This repository contains warious malware payloads and packages that I've constructed for research and study. 

These will generally spring a meterpreter shell that connects back to a 192.168.1.0/24 address, but may have other functionalities that will be documented in readme files included in the specific package's folder. 

Since these are not generally going to be released with source availible, for your own safety, ***only run these projects in a VM sandbox***. 

As always, these packages are only to be used for research or study in a lab environment!
