# README 

libfluidsynth64.dll is a malicious DLL proxy that executes windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https as a payload for lhost 192.168.1.246 and lport 443 

This is injected into explorer.exe's process using QueueUserAPC method of process injection, with the DLL being compiled with OLLVM for code obfuscation. 

The legitimate dll being proxied is libfluidsynth64_dev.dll. 

All other files should be clean. 

Created with ShhhLoader and msfvenom. 


This has been tested to successfully evade Windows Defender as of early 2023.
